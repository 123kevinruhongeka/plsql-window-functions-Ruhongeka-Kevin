1. Problem Definition
Business Context
Company: Triple C Restaurant
Industry: Hospitality & Food Service
Department: Sales & Marketing Analytics
Focus: Multi-location restaurant chain operating across major Rwandan regions (Kigali, Northern, Southern, Eastern, Western) specializing in premium dining experiences.

Data Challenge
Triple C Restaurant lacks systematic analysis of customer behavior patterns and product performance across different regions. The organization cannot effectively identify regional preferences, track sales trends, segment customers by value, or optimize menu offerings, leading to missed revenue opportunities and inefficient marketing spend.

Expected Outcome
This analysis will enable data-driven decisions for regional marketing strategies, menu optimization, customer retention programs, and revenue growth through comprehensive sales data analysis using PL/SQL window functions.

2. Success Criteria
5 Measurable Goals
Top 5 Products per Region/Quarter → Using RANK()

Running Monthly Sales Totals → Using SUM() OVER()

Month-over-Month Growth → Using LAG()/LEAD()

Customer Quartiles → Using NTILE(4)

3-Month Moving Averages → Using AVG() OVER()

    customer_id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR2(100) NOT NULL,
    region VARCHAR2(50) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR2(100),
    signup_date DATE
);

    product_id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR2(100) NOT NULL,
    category VARCHAR2(50) NOT NULL,
    price NUMBER(10,2),
    is_available CHAR(1) DEFAULT 'Y'
);

-- Transactions Table
CREATE TABLE transactions (
    transaction_id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id NUMBER NOT NULL,
    product_id NUMBER NOT NULL,
    sale_date DATE NOT NULL,
    amount NUMBER(10,2) NOT NULL,
    quantity NUMBER DEFAULT 1,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(product_id)
);
Sample Data
sql
-- Insert sample customers
INSERT INTO customers VALUES (1001, 'John Doe', 'Kigali', 'john.doe@email.com', DATE '2024-01-01');
INSERT INTO customers VALUES (1002, 'Alice Smith', 'Northern', 'alice.smith@email.com', DATE '2024-01-15');

-- Insert sample products
INSERT INTO products VALUES (2001, 'Grilled Chicken', 'Main Course', 8500, 'Y');
INSERT INTO products VALUES (2002, 'Beef Burger', 'Main Course', 6500, 'Y');

-- Insert sample transactions
INSERT INTO transactions VALUES (3001, 1001, 2001, DATE '2024-01-15', 8500, 1);
INSERT INTO transactions VALUES (3002, 1001, 2002, DATE '2024-01-20', 6500, 1);
4. Window Functions Implementation
4.1 Ranking Functions
sql
-- ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), PERCENT_RANK()
SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    c.name,
    c.region,
    SUM(t.amount) AS total_revenue,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(t.amount) DESC) AS row_num,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(t.amount) DESC) AS rank,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(t.amount) DESC) AS dense_rank,
    PERCENT_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(t.amount) DESC) AS percent_rank
FROM customers c
JOIN transactions t ON c.customer_id = t.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.name, c.region
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
Interpretation: This query ranks customers by total revenue using four different ranking methods, helping identify top performers and their relative positions in the customer base.

4.2 Aggregate Functions
sql
-- SUM(), AVG() with ROWS vs RANGE frames
SELECT 
    TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'YYYY-MM') AS sales_month,
    SUM(amount) AS monthly_sales,
    SUM(SUM(amount)) OVER (
        ORDER BY TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'YYYY-MM') 
        ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) AS running_total_rows,
    SUM(SUM(amount)) OVER (
        ORDER BY TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'YYYY-MM') 
        RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) AS running_total_range,
    AVG(SUM(amount)) OVER (
        ORDER BY TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'YYYY-MM')
        ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) AS moving_avg_3month
FROM transactions
GROUP BY TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'YYYY-MM')
ORDER BY sales_month;
Interpretation: Demonstrates running totals using different frame types (ROWS vs RANGE) and calculates 3-month moving averages to identify sales trends.

4.3 Navigation Functions
sql
-- LAG(), LEAD() for growth calculations
WITH monthly_sales AS (
    SELECT 
        TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'YYYY-MM') AS sales_month,
        SUM(amount) AS monthly_sales
    FROM transactions
    GROUP BY TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'YYYY-MM')
)
SELECT 
    sales_month,
    monthly_sales,
    LAG(monthly_sales, 1) OVER (ORDER BY sales_month) AS prev_month_sales,
    LEAD(monthly_sales, 1) OVER (ORDER BY sales_month) AS next_month_sales,
    ROUND(
        ((monthly_sales - LAG(monthly_sales, 1) OVER (ORDER BY sales_month)) / 
         LAG(monthly_sales, 1) OVER (ORDER BY sales_month)) * 100, 2
    ) AS growth_percent
FROM monthly_sales
ORDER BY sales_month;
Interpretation: Provides month-over-month growth analysis by comparing current sales with previous and next months, enabling trend identification.

4.4 Distribution Functions
sql
-- NTILE(4), CUME_DIST() for customer segmentation
WITH customer_stats AS (
    SELECT 
        c.customer_id,
        c.name,
        c.region,
        SUM(t.amount) AS total_spent,
        COUNT(t.transaction_id) AS transaction_count
    FROM customers c
    JOIN transactions t ON c.customer_id = t.customer_id
    GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.name, c.region
)
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    name,
    region,
    total_spent,
    transaction_count,
    NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY total_spent DESC) AS spending_quartile,
    ROUND(CUME_DIST() OVER (ORDER BY total_spent DESC), 3) AS cumulative_distribution,
    CASE 
        WHEN NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY total_spent DESC) = 1 THEN 'Platinum'
        WHEN NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY total_spent DESC) = 2 THEN 'Gold'
        WHEN NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY total_spent DESC) = 3 THEN 'Silver'
        ELSE 'Bronze'
    END AS customer_segment
FROM customer_stats
ORDER BY total_spent DESC;
Interpretation: Segments customers into four quartiles based on spending, enabling targeted marketing strategies for different customer value tiers.
